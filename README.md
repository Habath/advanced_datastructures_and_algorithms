# advanced_datastructures_and_algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various advanced data structures and algorithms in C/C++. 

## Data Structures Implemented:
- MinHeap: A binary heap data structure where the parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children.
- Binomial Heap: A heap similar to a binary heap but allows for efficient merging of heaps.
- B+ Tree: A self-balancing tree data structure used for storing and retrieving sorted data in a disk.
- Red-Black Tree: A balanced binary search tree where each node has an extra bit representing the color of the node.
- Splay Tree: A self-adjusting binary search tree that automatically moves frequently accessed elements nearer to the root.
- Quad Tree: A tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children.
- K-D Tree: A space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space.
- Hashing: Various hashing techniques like open addressing and chaining for efficient data retrieval.
- Maximal Flow: Algorithms to find the maximum flow in a flow network.

## Algorithms Implemented:
- Travelling Salesman Problem: Algorithms to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
- Knapsack Problem: Algorithms to find the most valuable combination of items that can be fit into a knapsack of limited capacity.
- K-Graph Coloring: Algorithms to color a graph's vertices using at most k different colors.
- Matrix Chain Multiplication: Algorithms to find the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices.
- Huffman Encoding: Algorithms to compress data by assigning variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies.
- Maximal Flow: Algorithms to find the maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a flow network.
